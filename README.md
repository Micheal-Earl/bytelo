This is a game developed using the LÖVE 2d game library.
In order to run this game you require the LÖVE 2d executable found at https://love2d.org/

Excerpt from the LÖVE website: "Hi there! LÖVE is an *awesome* framework you can use to make 2D games in Lua. It's free, open-source, and works on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android and iOS."

Once you have the executable, you can run my game from the commandline.

Navigate to bytelo/ and run 

```
love.exe .
```

This should execute love in the current directory (which in turn finds main.lua and launches the game)
